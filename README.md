 Recurrent algorithm for operation system.
 Here are my learning records of operating system algorithms. Currently includes multi-threading, process scheduling algorithms, deadlock avoidance algorithms, dynamic memory allocation algorithms, 
 and virtual memory replacement algorithms.
 Among them, PCB and linked-list are handmade designs, locks are added to the algorithm, and there is a sequence of scheduling between threads.


这个文件夹记录了我学习且复现了的操作系统算法。目前包括多线程、进程调度算法、死锁避免算法、动态内存分配算法、虚拟内存置换算法。
其中，PCB、链表都是手打设计，算法中加了锁，线程间调度有顺序。
